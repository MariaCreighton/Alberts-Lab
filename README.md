# Alberts-Lab
Data analysis project for the Alberts Lab at Duke University

Working with long-term behavioral data, this analysis answers outstanding questions about the impacts of reproductive status on baboon (Papio cynocephalus) foraging behavior, using SQL and RStudio to statistically analyze data on individual activity budgets from a 50-year behavioral dataset on baboons in the Amboseli basin of Kenya. The goal of the project is to determine group level social characteristics such as group size and social network density whether affect the efficiency of foraging behaviors and have different time budgets than females who are cycling or caring for semi-independent infants.

This analysis will inform decisions about which individuals should be sampled in a larger field project on baboon foraging and has potential to be a standalone research paper.
